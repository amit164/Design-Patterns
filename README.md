# Design Patterns

This is my implementation for some of the common Object Oriented Programming design patterns:

Bridge, Class Adapter, Command, Composite, Factory, Interpreter, Object Adapter, Observer and Proxy.


## Bridge
The Bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is meant to “decouple an abstraction from it’s implementation so that the two can vary independently”.

The Bridge uses encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance to separate responsibilities into different classes.

## Command

the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time.
